# Python to-do-app

#### Purpose and details

This is a Python app that serves as a simple to-do-list.

1. One can add entries via the UI
2. One can edit entries 


#### Changes

Previous Backend  : Sqlite3 ( Reason for choosing : none of that initiate a server first bullshit )

Proposed New Backend: UnQLite (sqlite is a relationalDB, I don't need a relational database)

Frontend : PyQT4 (the same for now)


#### Future Functionality and things to be added/done

1. Multi-list functionality
2. Better looking and simple UI
3. Delete entries
4. Cleaner and commented code
5. Detailed Wiki
6. Advanced Tests (including but not limited to mocking the database, integration tests)
7. Less emphasis on classes, this isn't a let-class-the-fuck-out-of-this-project project
8. Tui
9. Web interface
